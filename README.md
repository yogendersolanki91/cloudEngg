This is the an attempt to build highly fault-tolerance key value store based on Raft Consensus Algorithm.
It is implemented using Google Go language and ZeroMq.


Current status of project
 * Key Value Store
 * Server Cluster
 * Raft Leader Election 
 * Raft Log Replication




Features
--------------
 * GO language - that provides highly powerful concurrent programming paradigm.
 * ZerMQ - that provides fast and reliable communication.
 * Raft - that provide fault tolerance


Improved
